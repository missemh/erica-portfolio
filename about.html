            There are moments we all have in life that change our trajectory, moments that in hindsight, change
            everything. It sounds dramatic, and it should, because it is. One of those moments happened to me
            several years ago, and it’s very likely the reason I’m writing this letter to you now.
          </p>
          <p>
            What happened wasn’t dramatic at all. I half-heartedly accepted an invitation to visit my 3D artist
            friend’s office. I had no idea that what I saw that day would be so inspiring it would eventually lead me
            to move to a town outside the Arctic Circle in northern Sweden, become proficient in Python, graduate
            from AnimSchool, and dedicate my every waking hour to getting good at a job I hadn’t even known
            existed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think that begins to paint a picture of who I am. I have an
            endless sense of enthusiasm, I’m self-reliant, and I genuinely love what I do to the point where I literally
            jump for joy when I solve a problem. When I’m given a task, or give one to myself, I do whatever it
            takes to solve it, and to solve it as well as I possibly can. I don’t pretend to know everything, but I will
            always give everything to learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I finished my facial rig at AnimSchool, there were things I wasn’t happy with. It relied on the
            Maya interpolator, which I found unstable when triggering blend shapes, and the minor mouth
            controls often needed correction in certain expressions. So, I built my own triggering system with utility
            nodes and wrote code to place no fewer than 176 blend shapes onto the curves in the mouth rig,
            layered under the hood, to correct the shapes directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the words of my Advanced Rigging teacher at AnimSchool, I’m “one of the best students he has ever
            taught” and was “born to do this.”
